            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a second-year Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Birmingham passionate about blending technical problem-solving with client-facing collaboration. With a strong foundation in programming, data structures, and algorithm design, I enjoy diving into technical challenges but also thrive in environments where I can communicate complex ideas to a broader audience.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am seeking a summer internship where I can apply my technical skills while contributing to business goals and working directly with clients. Whether it is working on innovative software solutions, simplifying technical concepts, or collaborating with cross-functional teams, I aim to bring both creativity and clarity to every project I undertake.</p>
            <p>I am especially interested in roles that bridge the gap between technology and people. I am continuously honing my skills in both technical areas and soft skills to deliver value in dynamic and customer-oriented environments.</p>
